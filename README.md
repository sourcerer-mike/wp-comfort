# WordPress Comfort Plugin

With "Comfort" you get better usability for your customers
and solutions for common cases.
Your customer will see an even better and easier to handle WordPress
while your developers get all the tools to extend it even more.
Feel free to brand it with your name
because this plugin is whitelabeled.

As a developer I always repeat myself with every project
and dislike the missing OOP in WordPress.
While enhancing WordPress with modern techniques
some neat magic will come along:

- All Widgets will also be Shortcodes.
- All Post-Types can be shown as a form in the Frontend.
